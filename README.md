# Roaming Roombas: DIY Social Robot Platform

Roaming Roombas is a versatile, low-cost platform for building expressive and customizable social robots using the Create3 Roomba as a movement hub. Designed for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research and education, it enables rapid prototyping through 3D printing or cardboard crafting, and supports real-time facial expressions and behavior control via Python or ROS2.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily adapt robot size and appearance using 3D printed or cardboard components.
- **Expressive Faces**: Display reactive facial expressions on a touchscreen or mobile device.
- **Flexible Behaviors**: Define robot actions using a storyboard-driven software architecture.
- **Open Source**: Hardware designs and software are customizable and extensible.
- **Low-Cost**: Build robots for under \$600 USD using accessible materials and components.
