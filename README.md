# Roaming Roombas: DIY Social Robot Platform

Roaming Roombas is a versatile, low-cost platform for building expressive and customizable social robots using the Create3 Roomba as a movement hub. Designed for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research and education, it enables rapid prototyping through 3D printing or cardboard crafting, and supports real-time facial expressions and behavior control via Python or ROS2.

## üöÄ Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily adapt robot size and appearance using 3D printed or cardboard components.
- **Expressive Faces**: Display reactive facial expressions on a touchscreen or mobile device.
- **Flexible Behaviors**: Define robot actions using a storyboard-driven software architecture.
- **Open Source**: Hardware designs and software are customizable and extensible.
- **Low-Cost**: Build robots for under \$600 USD using accessible materials and components.

## üß± Architecture

### Hardware
- **Movement Hub**: iRobot Create3
- **Controller**: Raspberry Pi 4B
- **Face Display**: 7" touchscreen or mobile device
- **Sensors**: IR proximity and bump sensors
- **Power**: Powered via Create3‚Äôs onboard battery
  
A full price list with links to necessary components is available in the Hardware folder above. 

### Software
- **Languages**: Python or ROS2
- **Components**:
  - `MotionNode`: Manages movement phases and sensor input
  - `PhaseController`: Links behaviors to expressions
  - `BlinkManager`: Adds lifelike blinking
  - `Storyboard`: Maps user-defined scenarios to robot actions
